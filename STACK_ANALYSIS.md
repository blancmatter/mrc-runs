# Technology Stack Analysis & Recommendations

**Date**: October 2025
**Project**: MRC Runs Management System
**Purpose**: Evaluate current stack and recommend improvements for deployment, hosting, performance, and UX

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: Good foundation with Django + SQLite + Bootstrap
**Recommendation**: **Keep Django** for now, but modernize deployment and add minor enhancements
**Alternative Path**: Consider BaaS migration for long-term scalability (6-12 months out)

---

## Current Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Django 4.2
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Database**: SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: Django built-in auth
- **API**: None (server-side rendering only)

### Frontend
- **Templating**: Django Templates
- **CSS Framework**: Bootstrap 5
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS (minimal)
- **PWA**: Service Worker + Manifest

### Deployment
- **Current**: Likely local/manual
- **Database**: SQLite (not production-ready)
- **Static Files**: Served via Django (inefficient)

## Conclusion

**My Strong Recommendation: Path 1 (Django Enhancement)**

Why:
1. You have a working, tested Django app
2. Django admin is invaluable for managing runs
3. ~4-5 hours gets you production-ready on Railway
4. Can add modern features (HTMX) incrementally
5. Great learning: deployment, PostgreSQL, CI/CD
6. Low cost (~$7/month)
7. No risk of half-finished migration

**Appwrite is interesting but:**
- 50-70 hour rewrite is significant
- Django admin is too valuable to lose
- Can always migrate later if needs change

**Start here:**
1. This week: Deploy to Railway
2. Next week: Add HTMX
3. Month 2: CI/CD + monitoring
4. Month 3: REST API if building mobile app

You'll have a modern, production-ready app without throwing away your excellent Django work!
